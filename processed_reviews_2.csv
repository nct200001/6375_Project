"The best professor, 10/10 recommend. I actually go to class even though it was not mandatory."| "1.0, -1.0"
"When people said Professor Polze is the best professor they have taken, I wanted to experience his class for myself. When he teaches, you can tell he loves being up there, finding ways to connect to students or break down concepts very easily. He made BLAW more enjoyable for me and in the process gave some key takeaways about life with an impact."| "1.0, 0.5"
"Polze is probably the best professor I have ever taken. Just show up to class and the 3 exams will be cake. No extra credit but it shouldn't be needed."| "1.0, 0.5"
"Hands-down best professor at UTD. Caring and respectful, he finds a way to make each lecture engaging and the discussions in class were thought-provoking."| "1.0, 0.5"
"The way I figured out how to get higher scores on writing assignments is to include more art and be creative and unique. He reads off a slideshow but makes up for it with plenty of commentary. I ended up super satisfied, so I highly recommend Mr. Polze."| "1.0, -0.0"
"Professor Polze is amazing, great, awesome, cool, wonderful, perfect, extraordinary, marvelous, miraculous, spectacular, stupendous, terrific, fabulous, outstanding, and phenomenal. Best professor at UTD. He goes above and beyond for his students."| "1.0, -0.5"
"Polze will go the extra mile to make you feel engaged with the content of the class. Highly recommend him. Makes me feel like I am at home."| "1.0, 1.0"
"Amazing lectures and genuinely cares about his students. As long as you attend his lectures and take some notes, you'd do fine on the exams. There are three online exams and one writing assignment."| "1.0, 1.0"
"I hate school, but I genuinely loved Polze's class. He is such a great lecturer and person. He tries really hard to keep you engaged the whole time and his jokes are hilarious. Tests are online open note, the first one was the hardest. Don't skip class because he always hints at test questions."| "1.0, -0.0"
"Professor Polze is officially the best professor and teacher I've ever had. He's is ridiculously funny, and brings smiles to everyone's faces. He's a great role model. Tests are open note and online. No group projects, only a couple of easy essays. I'm considering going into law because of Prof. P. Can't be enough said about how fantastic he is!"| "1.0, 1.0"
"I can't say enough good things about Polze! This class definitely wasn't easy, but it pushed me in a good way. The quality of work I produced was so much better at the end of the semester compared to the start. Just do your work, and you'll get a good grade. His lectures are very engaging, and he cares so much about every single student!"| "1.0, -0.5"
"Professor Polze was genuinely one of the healthiest influences in my life. He teaches you about law but also tries to teach you how to be better- period. His first 1 or 2 grades will be low- but that only those. He is a charismatic, sophisticated, disciplined role model that is more inspirational than anyone I have ever met. Take him."| "1.0, -0.0"
"Please do yourself a huge favor and take Professor Polze's class. I have never enjoyed a class as much as I enjoyed his. You can tell this mans passions lay in teaching. every day is exciting and fun. On top of that, the tests are open-book and pretty easy as long as you pay attention to the presentation."| "1.0, 0.5"
"Best professor/teacher I've ever had - knows everything and teaches it well. Always go to lectures and write down the examples he uses. For writing assignments, show him drafts during office hours so he can edit them. Also a great person to talk to for personal advice - the sole reason I made it through the semester even though it was really hard!"| "1.0, -0.5"
"Polze might be the best professor in the school. Amazing lectures and funny stories made going to class a much easier decision. Not the easiest class ever, but he tries his best to help everyone out. Writing assignments are easy once you realize they aren't about writing, but creativity. Absolute 10/10."| "1.0, -0.0"
"Best teacher ever. He makes class fun and interesting. 1 writing assignment and 3 exams. Exams are open book and open notes. You don't even have to study for them to get an A."| "1.0, 1.0"
"Professor Polze is the type of professor you will remember years after taking and recall his class with excitement and gratitude. His assignments are challenging but designed to push you forwards, and he goes out of his way to be accessible. If you have the chance to take his class, I cannot recommend it enough."| "1.0, -0.0"
"If you have the choice to take this professor, just do it. He makes you want to come to class. Sometimes the lecture material is very dry, but he really tells interesting stories to engage the class. He really cares about all his students and its readily apparent. He is always available and super knowledgable and just wants to see you succeed!"| "1.0, 0.5"
"Absolutely amazing professor. Exams are online and open-book, not many other graded things besides the exams, but you'll be fine as long as you take notes and listen to his lectures. His lectures are fun to listen to and participate in. He does his best to get students involved and is a genuine guy. Take him if you can!!"| "1.0, 0.5"
"I got a D in this class -- and I know it wasn't due to a lack of effort or intelligence because I got an A when I retook the class with a different professor. All of his assignments were writing-based, and his approach to grading them was absurd. His standards were arbitrary, his feedback was nonsensical, and figuring him out was impossible."| "-1.0, -1.0"
"I came to class 4 minutes late and she marked me absent but she marked other people present that came 10+ minutes late, she calls people out pls dont take if you love yourself."| "-1.0, 0.5"
"Overly strict for no reason. Kind of a rude teacher and has a lot of attitude. Not engaging. Very nit-picky on CS code which isn't even related to the code itself but the comments. No earbuds, if you get caught wearing earbuds you will get called out in front of the whole class and even risk being absent. The assigned seats thing is very childish."| "-1.0, -0.5"
"creepy smile, do not take if you want a free grade"| "-1.0, -1.0"
"Professor Thompson's class is challenging but engaging. Attendance is mandatory, and the exams focus heavily on coding, so studying the textbook and using tools like Unstuckstudy for practice are key to success. Overall, a worthwhile course if you're willing to put in the work."| "0.0, -0.5"
"Tough grader, not kind to students"| "-1.0, -1.0"
"Horrible, do not take."| "-1.0, -1.0"
"This is the toughest grader ever, she will nitpick you with every little mistake that has nothing to do with the code and mainly with the Code Comments like it's an English class. You will lose points if you forget a single space or tab."| "-1.0, -1.0"
"Overall, she is kind and respectful at times but also strict and treats students like highschool, no earbuds during lectures or she will yell at you. She is very nitpicky when it comes to programing style guideline. Oh, you forget a single space? Minus points. You forget a single tab? Minus Points. Hardly ever getting 100 in lab..."| "-0.5, -1.0"
"Thought she was gonna be great, but she proved me wrong.After a month she made a seating chart on the one day I wasn't in class.She marked me absent for the next class after that just because I wasn't in the right seat (that I didn't choose) even though she talked to me during attendence.I just completely stopped going to class and still got a B..."| "-0.5, -0.0"
"Do not take this professor: very exam heavy and lecture heavy. Teaches materials less than a week before exam and has seating charts."| "-1.0, -1.0"
"Goes in depth on content/explains things well, but takes an hour to explain what could as easily be done in 30 min+makes you stay in class (2hr15m long) until you finish that day's lab, which she doesnt give access to until after 1hr+ lecture. Avoid her if u can, the evil laugh thing is not a joke.2 exams-70%, labs-15%,assignments-10%,attendance-5%"| "0.0, -0.0"
"Thompson is a pretty decent teacher in that she goes in depth but that causes her to be 1-2 weeks behind other classes. But she only has 2 labs per week, 3 coding assignments, and only 2 tests. But you have to write code on the test so I recommend to take another professor cause 50% of test grade is coding which is take-home. Overall, she's fine."| "0.0, -0.0"
"This class is NOT beginner friendly. The grading criteria is overwhelmingly unfair. If you are new to coding, unless you spend all day every day trying to learn this you aren't passing. The exams have questions that she never even mentions during the lectures. Like windows processes??? Just feels rigged. Also, she's weird and laughs like a maniac."| "-1.0, -1.0"
"She gives 2 tests throughout the semester, which is the midterm (35%) and the final (35%) which makes up for 70%, attendance is mandatory, and she will even count you late if you are not on time. Lectures can get boring since she is just reading off the slides, there are labs every single class, If you dont know how to code, then dont take it."| "-1.0, -1.0"
"Took her as a freshmen, and now I'm a senior. This professor is really the bottom of the barrel. I had already been programming for several years. Her teaching was obtuse and removed from learning; thus, it made things hard despite already knowing what I was doing. Her tests asked overly specific questions, including things about her personal life."| "-1.0, -0.5"
"Great professor, easily to understand and follow along. She will answer any question you have while not faulting you for asking. It is a very exam focused call so study for the Exams. I recommend you read the book to get a better understanding of C++. The textbook also has a lot of the solutions for assignments and lab assignment."| "1.0, -0.0"
"For a freshman course, she makes her test and overall assignments in a way that if you don't read the textbook back to back you're going to fail. Avoid her at all cost, I would wait for next semester if she's the only professor available. Mandatory attendance and she starts counting attendance 5min before the class starts."| "-1.0, -1.0"
"She takes her time and explains the code really well. The test can be short in the fact that some of the code traces weigh a lot on the test so make sure you don't mess up in the code traces or else the whole question gets marked wrong. The labs and the practice assignments arn't bad and are engaging and helpful."| "1.0, -0.0"
"*Note this is for CS 1136 NOT CS 1336* Never met Prof Thompson in person, as the TA's ran the lab, but received multiple emails throughout the course regarding hints with assignments, extensions for labs, and additional submissions on Zylabs (sent to everyone in the class). Accommodations were reasonable, and the lab was not hard overall."| "0.0, 0.5"
"Worst cs professor , if you take her just be prepared to take labs at 9pm with no real help . Attendance is mandatory and she starts class 5 min early to take attendance (so if you come to class on time she'll mark you late)  , and makes class last 15m longer , so prepare to have 20m wasted . Her laugh is absolutely diabolical and makes you cringe."| "-1.0, -1.0"
"Engaging lectures, but deceptively simple. Review before class and use unstuck study for study prep. Open-ended exams are tough, but daily work helps. Professor is enthusiastic and wants students to succeed."| "0.5, -0.5"
"Not a self-paced course, you must actively follow along to do well. Professor Robert was very approachable and kindly willing to stay behind after class to provide help with workshops. His office hours are very helpful too. Several quizzes and exams but no drops on exams, however he generously curves."| "1.0, -1.0"
"Great professor with engaging lectures, but they're deceptively simple. Review the lectures the night before and take notes. If you take honors, know that the exams are open-ended; the bulk of the questions come from the content taught earlier in the unit. As much as daily ungraded homework sucks, it does help, and so does going to office hours."| "1.0, -0.5"
"If you can, I highly recommend taking Dr. Sibert for inorganic chemistry! There was a good amount of preparation put in for the tests with plenty of quizzes and workshops to study from. Make sure to not skip class because it's easy to get lost without."| "1.0, -0.0"
"Professor Sibert is very nice. He's such a dad. He goes on a lot of tangents but he's a great teacher. He's really easy to reach, and he reviewed exams with me when I asked him to help me with my mistakes. He's a piper professor for a reason!"| "0.5, -0.0"
"Professor Sibert has the tenacity and spirit to teach. He is a great person with an amazing sense of humor; however, his lectures are a bit too dry. He teaches the theoretical aspects of chemistry and not the application aspects, but the application aspects is all that matters for exams. Overall, I wouldn't recommend taking this class with him."| "-0.5, -1.0"
"Though I think highly of Professor Sibert, I didn't appreciate the honors section. He had a propensity to veer off-topic. I never understood why he gave us difficult open-ended exams while the regular sessions did not. If you are taking other challenging subjects or have time-consuming ECs, it can be tough to complete the daily ungraded homework."| "0.0, -0.5"
"In general, he's a good professor. If you get him for gen. chem. you should be okay. Just know that he can go off-topic sometimes, and moves around content. He also has thing about midterm grades where he avoids putting them in until the last second, which could be either good or bad depending on you."| "0.0, -0.5"
"Dr. Sibert is an incredible professor in my eyes. He clearly explains the topics and is really down to earth. Others complain about his tendency to go off on tangents, but I find them very interesting (mostly because I do the same thing). Of course, you need to work hard, but he definitely loves teaching and wants everyone to learn and succeed."| "1.0, -0.0"
"He is the best professor in chemistry department. He truly cares about students and puts his students first. Recommend him 100%"| "1.0, 0.5"
"Gen chem 1 was very difficult, but Dr. Sibert was able to explain everything in a very bite sized piece way. However do not take him if you are prone to skipping class because you will not be able to succeed. However, for those who put in the effort and study hard, you should be able to get a decent grade. However, it's not a class that you can BS."| "0.5, -0.0"
"i was worried taking ochem 2 over the summer because i struggled with ochem 1 but dr. sibert is a wonderful professor and attending lectures + review sessions were really helpful. not a lot of people went to his reviews but he went over the review questions in detail. his exams were exactly like his reviews with a few textbook hw questions."| "1.0, -0.0"
"Quite possibly the hardest class I have taken so far, Professor Sibert himself is a nice guy but he tends to go off on random motivational tangents during lecture that take up half the class time. You will need to put hours of work into Gen Chem if you want to pass."| "0.0, -1.0"
"Sibert is amazing at explaining concepts and he genuinely is interested in the success of his students. Easily the best gen chem teacher. He made gen chem manageable and actually enjoyable. His office hours and reviews are gold. If you want to get an A, go to class, do PLTL, do ALL the homework, attend his lectures, and go to his office hours."| "1.0, -0.0"
"Professor Sibert honestly gets a lot of unnecessary hate. Chemistry is a relatively difficult subject to understand and often times it's a lack of preparation that causes students to not do well. PLTL is not very helpful for this course but doing the homework is crucial, you will not do well without it. Attend workshops if you can, they help a lot."| "1.0, -0.0"
"Ochem 2 is hard, regardless on the professor. I did not do well in Ochem 1 however, I did very well in this class because the professor provides a well-thought out study plan. Even though it is not required to complete to readings or the homework, I highly recommend it! Practicing the problems repeatedly is the only way to do well on exams."| "1.0, -0.5"
"Dr. Sibert is kind, but makes the class unnecessarily difficult. If you only listen to lectures and do some hw problems, it's unlikely that you'll do well on exams. Also, his lectures often make the concepts more confusing than they are. He's a good gen chem prof, but I don't recommend him for a difficult course like organic chemistry 2."| "-0.5, -1.0"
"Goes off on random tangents for most of the lectures then tries to run through 5 lectures worth of material in one hour. The tests themselves are tricky, and he is not generous with curving. You are better off with another gen chem professor."| "-1.0, -0.5"
"The online setting of honors chem 1315 definitely played a part in how awful this class was, but I hated everything. Sibert goes off on tangents all the time and his notes are mostly horrible photocopied diagrams. However, he is a very caring prof and he curved our final grades (but nobody knows what his grading scale is still). Read the textbook!"| "-0.5, -0.5"
"This is the absolute worst professor I have ever taken. He used extensive grammar that made no sense what so ever to explain the topics. He gets off topic a lot!!! Very rude and disrespectful when you try to email him regarding questions you have. AVOID AT ALL COSTS."| "-1.0, -1.0"
"Do not take Taylor please be smart. If I had to retake the class I would do it with Huang. He is the best teacher without a doubt. Taylor is always behind in lectures and does everything except teach chemistry. She loves to talk on and on and get off track. It's embarrassing how bad she is. Don't be fooled by other reviews on here, TAKE HUANG."| "-1.0, -0.0"
"Professor Taylor is one of the best chem 1311 teachers as you can tell she really cares. She's extremely passionate and encourages her students to ask questions. Additionally, she goes through the course content thoroughly (sometimes, we got behind because of how detailed she got, however, she always made sure we knew everything before the exams)."| "1.0, -0.0"
"Her lectures are usually fine but sometimes she can go on tangents. Otherwise she explains everything pretty well. Mandatory attendance is on Fridays but sometimes she'll put the attendance credit online. She's great in office hours as well. Her exam reviews are based on questions from the MS teams chat (not structured)."| "0.5, -0.5"
"She is a great lecture, but doesn't have a lot of patience for dumb questions so pay attention well."| "0.5, 0.5"
"Unfortunately, teachers like Taylor hold prominent positions and seem to lack empathy. Personality differences pose a challenge when your professor sends sarcastic and wounding remarks. I would advocate to take another professor such as Dr Dieckman."| "-0.5, -1.0"
"She is good at teaching and makes concepts clear and easy to understand. When I took the course she let you schedule private MS Teams meetings with her to ask questions before the exam too which was great."| "1.0, -0.0"
"I am sorry to anyone in the UTeach Science Program that has to take this class. Taylor is a good chemistry teacher, but was terrible for NATS 4390 (NATS 4390 was not an option above)"| "-1.0, -1.0"
"Dr. Taylor's teaching style works very well for me. I found it very helpful when she would lead the class through a practice problem. We would also do a worksheet every Friday, partially as a class and partially on our own. I found her lectures to be engaging and interesting."| "1.0, -0.0"
"I liked Dr. Taylor, however she tends to ramble which makes us late in learning the material. Also, if you're not ready for lowkey passive agressive-ness then don't take her."| "0.5, -0.0"
"Great professor. To do well on the exams, do a lot of practice questions. From what I remember, the online suggested textbook questions that the professor provides really helped me when studying. Practice exams are also helpful too. If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask her - she's very kind! SI Sessions were also good too for more practice."| "0.5, -0.0"
"taylor is good if you're new to taking high-level chemistry; otherwise, i would stay clear of her. she teaches content in a very basic manner, making her lectures quite uninteresting. also, her slides are not good compared to other professors (like huang's). participation is only mandatory on fridays, which is the only time i go."| "0.0, 0.5"
"From what I've heard, she's one of the better Gen Chem professors. Course is hard, but she makes it fun. Attendance is only mandatory on Friday lectures (MWF course). Slides alone don't make sense but she explains them really well in class so it'll be fine if you go to class and pay attention."| "1.0, -0.0"
"There are 2 homework assignments per week (must pay for ALEKS). Slides are somewhat vague, but she explains it thoroughly in class. Likes to use the doc cam and write things out. Likes to use real world examples. Attendance only mandatory on Friday, where she will do an ungraded workshop (worksheet). Textbook not mandatory (comes with ALEKS)."| "0.5, 0.5"
"Her class was simple, tons of resources to prepare for the tests, attendance is mandatory once a week since it's part of your grade. She's a fun lecturer, but she takes her job seriously and makes sure everyone is caught up to speed. Very nice!"| "1.0, 0.5"
"Dr. Taylor was overall a good prof! She was pretty easily accesible outside of class and was generally helpful with everything. Sometimes her lecture slides don't make that much sense if you are not actually present in class when she is lecturing but otherwise she is timely and very approachable with questions!"| "0.5, -0.0"
"Loved taking this class with Dr. Taylor. She is super nice and lenient with grading. If you have any questions or are curious about anything even remotely tangent to the class topic, she will gladly discuss it with you. Paper and project topics are always interesting, and alot of the times you can choose the topic yourself."| "1.0, 0.5"
"Exceptionally kind and sweet. Dr. Taylor is very passionate about the course content, and taught me a lot about the environment. Class is super laid back and she is very accommodating of late work. She cares about her students and answering questions. Highly recommend this class to complete a CV and science credit, especially for non-STEM majors."| "1.0, 1.0"
"Overall, she is a great teacher who would answer any questions you have in class. Slides are provided and the best part is any documents or notes she went over, even the ones she hand-written, would be accessible. The only setback is that sometimes she falls behind teaching and would crap information last minute, maybe even one day before exams"| "0.5, 1.0"
"Dr. Taylor is by far the best professor at UTD. She is amazing for such a tough course, she always provides extensive feedback too which is really helpful. The class itself it really difficult which is why some people may find her teaching confusing or too fast  paced. Although the class is fast paced, she will slow down for you in office hours"| "1.0, -0.0"
"Attendance only mandatory on fridays"| "1.0, -0.0"
"Explanations are very hard to understand, had to self-study the course using the textbook and Kimberly Brehm. Recently Discrete I and II were combined meaning there was a very large amount of material to cover (studied many hours per week). Assigns very little work in the honors section so you are essentially on your own (for test prep)."| "-0.5, -1.0"
"Incomprehensible and absolutely uninteresting lectures. He cares but still lectures are skippable. You can read the book CLRS and get an easy A."| "-1.0, -0.0"
"Very disorganized professor. Changed the syllabus after first midterm. No consistency on enforcing the rule or syllabus. Worst professor I have encountered at UTD. Very lazy trying to do the least amount of work by making test questions as few as possible. Would never take again."| "-1.0, -0.5"
"Professor Bereg is a solid professor. His lectures are a bit dry, but if you pay attention he actually explains topics pretty well. Homeworks are about every 2 weeks and are moderately difficult. Exams are easy if you kept up with the class and are passable if you cram. Cheatsheets are allowed. Overall, organized and consistent class."| "0.5, -0.0"
"While his lectures are kind of unclear on what he's actually teaching, if you pay attention and read the textbook you'll understand what he's trying to say. Tests are 80% of your grade, and assignments are pretty difficult, but both are graded easily, and tests give you a basically unlimited cheat sheet, so just test prep well and fill it up."| "0.5, -0.5"
"Prof Bereg instructional effectiveness leaves much to be desired. No class structure, reliance solely on textbook slides during lectures, and difficulty in hearing him speak are shortcomings. Weekly HW is vague questions with harsh grading. Overall he ranks as one of the least effective professors I've encountered at UTD. Tests 80% of course grade."| "-1.0, -1.0"
"Singlehandedly the worst class I have taken in my 4 years at UTD. Prof. Bereg is very nice and clearly knowledgeable but has no business teaching. He is a very quiet lecturer and reads straight from the textbook on the projector every single class. The HWs are very frequent and will take you until the last second to complete. Grading is ROUGH."| "-1.0, -1.0"
"Prof Bereg is caring, helpful, and tries his best to impart knowledge. His lectures are hard to follow though, so you will need to prep before classes to follow what he's teaching. Hard assignments, but if you can do those, you can do the exams without much trouble. Class is theory-oriented (No programming), hardly helps much for interview prep."| "0.5, 0.5"
"It was a good class, but sometimes Dr. Bereg was hard to hear. He spoke fairly quietly, but overall he got the point across."| "0.5, -0.5"
"It's discrete 1, so you'll be fine if you study a bit and practice the one or two proofs given in class each unit. Exams weren't hard but required proofs but graded easily. Lecturing is meh, way too carried away by some examples."| "0.0, 0.5"
"Dr Bereg lectures will be easy to understand only if you read the syllabus upfront otherwise you will get lost during lectures. Because of his low voice. Due to his expertise in the subject, explains the concepts simplified manner. Exams are 40 percent each, careful!"| "1.0, -0.5"
"Good lecturer, sometimes jumps around but generally stays on track. Asks for class participation, which sometimes makes lectures drag on. 6 assignments (about biweekly) worth 20% and two exams worth 40% each. Exams aren't easy but not super difficult, and cheat sheets are allowed ."| "1.0, -0.5"
"As the semester ends, professor teaches subjects really fast. Choose him if you wish to get an A and not attend his classes. Choose him if you can self-study and not rely on his lectures."| "-1.0, -0.0"
"Amazing professor!"| "1.0, 0.5"
"Bereg is a good professor and expects a lot from his students. I needed to do a lot of independent reading and practice problems to prepare for the tests. There were only 2 tests, each worth 40% so take them seriously. The example problems and exercises in the book were very helpful on the test. Lectures go fast as a lot is covered."| "1.0, -0.5"
"It was my most enjoyable class this semester. His lectures were interesting and the homework wasn't too long. His voice is kind of quiet so it is a little hard to understand him at times. The tests were easier than the homework. He posts his notes but make sure to go to class because the notes don't cover everything taught."| "1.0, 0.5"
"We should pay a lot of attention in class to understand the topics. Text book is good. Need to think a lot for home work questions. Both exams were really hard and could be cracked only if our concepts are clear."| "0.5, 1.0"
"Awesome professor for algorithms. Great teaching style and I really enjoyed the detailed analysis in his class."| "1.0, -0.0"
"He doesnt really post notes online. Notes would come from his lectures. He did offer a small booklet of notes that he created for the class if you want to buy it... For tests you can bring 2 pages of notes front and back. Expect most questions based on the hw and atleast one question youve never really seen before."| "0.0, -0.5"
"This professor was meh. Lectures were hard to follow. I couldnt understand his accent too well. Tough grader on homework but pretty lenient grader on test. I felt like homework grading criteria was not clear. I had to self study A LOT."| "-0.5, -1.0"
"I took this over the summer and His exams were crazy but doable I guess it would be 400 slides for each exam, take this class with a easy semester and easy classes and not in summer"| "-0.5, -0.5"
"The course itself is very difficult, but doable if you keep up with studying and don't procrastinate. Dr. Ramirez was an okay professor, but he teaches extremely fast (200 slides in 3 hours). Slides and lectures are very long, but everything is fair game including the textbook and anything he mentions. Stay on top of things and you will be fine."| "0.0, -0.5"
"Unlike what other ppl said,his class is totally doable if you read textbook before class, go to class, and read them again after class. As long as you follow this routine you can get A+ for sure. I'm a bio major (which means exam 3, 4 materials quite new to me), but I did well on all 4 exams. Don't complain about how hard it is. Just study."| "1.0, -0.5"
"bad professor. very rude in class and does not grade with very good feedback. tests are too difficult and go over material that was not gone over in class. would not take again...."| "-1.0, -1.0"
"He has a monotone tone and he rushes through his lectures, so you won't understand anything. "Everything is fair game" in his exams, so don't bother on asking him on what to study.  Over a 100 slides to study a week and need to read the entire chapter on the textbook. Constantly says the book is wrong and his exams are brutal."| "-1.0, -1.0"
"Dr. Ramirez made this already difficult class more difficult. The exams are impossible! 3-hour lectures are rushed and unorganized. Rameriez constantly says the textbook is wrong, but will ask questions on the exams from the textbook. "everything is fair game" including random facts said in class."| "-1.0, -1.0"
"To do well in this course, you must stay on top of your work. The exams are not hard if you study well and early. Do not procrastinate otherwise you will do bad. You can get an A if you put in the effort. Pay attention in lectures, take good notes, go home and read the txtbk, and understand the material and you will do well."| "1.0, -0.5"
"Dr. Ramirez makes this class extremely difficult.  The lectures are long and hard to digest.  If he is running low on time, he will skip through 15 slides of powerpoints.

"Professor Ramirez has really awesome lectures. He's obviously knowledgeable, and has some very cool insight for pre-med students. However, he assigns INSANE amounts of information to each exam. At one point, exam three encompassed over half of the 1,200 page textbook, plus all lecture material. He is super cool, but he will drown you in work."| "-0.5, -1.0"
"This was my most favorite but hardest class this semester. Prof. Ramirez is really passionate when teaching and wants us to be prepared in the healthcare field.

"This class is amazing!! You'll learn A LOT! But in order to at least pass, you MUST attend lec; missing one class will hurt your exam for sure! Only 3 exams and a case study.  Yes, he can be intimidating, but Dr. R genuinely cares about his students. If you approach him respectfully and show interest in learning, he'll help you and advise you well."| "0.5, -0.5"
"Hardest class I've taken so far. He really cares about getting you ready for med school so his tests are very detailed and require you to master a huge amount of information.

"Dr. Ramirez, without a doubt, is one of the most brutal Biology department professors I have ever encountered.

"He is a pretty straight forward teacher. That's the only one perk about his class. Ppl think lacking good study habits always correlates to bad grades. That's not true.

"Not a bad professor, but she does not post her in class examples and notes that are far more helpful than the slides. Slides are basically useless and she goes way too fast in lectures.

All essays are meant to be based on lectures. By the end of the class, ended up writing a total of around 35 pages of essays. Fairly easy grade but not worth the work."| "-1.0, -1.0"
"Dr.Wright is a good professor, but you have to be very engaged in his lectures to do well. Participation in a weekly discussion based off a lot of readings from old English sources. Two exams, each consisting of 3 essays, along with a final essay and then a "creative" project. Pay attention & take good notes you can get an A or B but requires work."| "0.0, -1.0"
"I wouldn't recommend this class to anyone who is not a history major.

Acts like its the most important course ever, stay away!"| "-1.0, -1.0"
"This is the worst intro class I've ever taken. First thing he said was he purposefully made it harder than it needs to be.

"He talks for hours in a truly literary way, without slides or textbooks. Most of the time I didn't know what I was learning. And his workbook wasn't well organized either. I felt like I was in a literature or politics class. Especially, his tests and his workbook were written in a literary format that was difficult or confusing to understand."| "-1.0, -1.0"
"He's a nice old dude; reminds me of my grandpa. He tells stories in the long old people kind of way. His lectures are lengthy, and he states his opinions on capitalism/ the economy for the whole time. Again, he's not a bad guy + his class isn't hard. The tests are super easy just use the coursebook that he provides. Easy A, just a little boring."| "0.0, 1.0"
"I would just take ba 1320 with him if there are no other options. His lectures are boring and mainly tangents, but the exams are super easy. Just kinda memorize the "workbook". Only giving him a 3 and not lower because at least you don't have to purchase his "workbook", all the answers are basically in there, and he curves the exam grades by a lot."| "0.0, 1.0"

"Professor entire course preaching libertarian nonsense.  The lectures were very short (7 modules w/ ~30 mins of lecture for each module). I learned nothing other than 'Government bad, free market good' according to him. The tests also sucked because many questions are opinionated.  Overall terrible class, don't take it. Class average was a C+."| "-1.0, -0.5"
"Prof Lewin is a seemingly nice person, but his lectures are incredibly difficult to follow. If you aren't already well versed in business economics, you will struggle as I did. He is obviously incredibly knowledgeable and will assume you are, too. This class is by default difficult, and Prof Lewin does not make it easier."| "-1.0, -1.0"
"This class seems to have a bunch of information that comes from seemingly nowhere. He has his own "course workbook" wherein he basically reads off of in class, and he goes on a tangent often.

"Professor Lewin makes for interesting lectures, but on occasion they can get uninteresting.

Basically, do the papers write down the pop quizzes answers for your exam."| "-0.5, -0.0"
"This is probably the worst class I've had to take, he gives a "surprise" pop quiz every day you come in over a chapter he has you read in 2 days, some being 50 pages long.

If you're not a first semester freshman  who's a business, engineering, or pre-med major I highly don't recommend you take him because you'll be wasting you're time doing extremely ridiculous projects that make you feel like you're still in middle school. Also a Tough Grader"| "-1.0, -0.0"
"Probably one of the most annoying classes ever. He thinks all of his students are actively trying to pursue arts degrees, and makes his class ridiculously over the top and flamboyant.

"At the beginning of the semester I thought the class was kinda tough. However, he gave us opportunities for 4 points extra on our final grade and if we had good attendance would bump us up.

"Great professor. Hands down recommend him to anyone who needs an art credit. Vey easy and interesting class as well. He is passionate about the arts and has a vast knowledge of it. Read the assigned chapters to the quizzes and take notes from the lectures too. 3 Essays up to 4 pages. Very easy class if you just pay attention."| "1.0, 0.5"
"Not a demanding class, but busy and annoying. Lectures are boring and carry no substance. He'll show you countless photos of places that he has been to. Like/Dislike your projects for random reasons. I would recommend taking other class for arts credits. This class neither teaches me much about arts nor inspires me to learn more."| "-0.5, -0.0"
"Professor Stone gives quizzes just about every other class once you get going in the school year.

The quizzes are supposedly unannounced, but he will usually mention them the class before."| "0.5, -0.0"
"Stone is very endearing the first week, and then you get more and more annoyed with each class. Lots of pop quizzes over readings, doesn't give clear guidelines for the final group project, and then he sits there for an entire class period and roasts the groups in front of everyone. Easy class, def would've taken something else given the chance."| "-0.75, -0.0"

And finally one group project he harshly critiques. I do not recommend this class & professor."| "-0.5, -1.0"
"Dr. Stone certainly makes you work for your points: 2 tests (no review but all multiple choice), 3 essays (3-4 pages each), and a billion pop quizzes. The professor is rather irritating and unfunny. Do the extra credit. Each extra credit opportunity is an extra 1% on your grade and 4% makes a huge difference."| "0.25, -0.5"
"Try to take someone else if at all possible. I compared my 13 page final report, which I got a C- on, to a friend's 8 page report, who got an A with a different professor, and mine was MUCH better and MUCH more in depth. Definitely worth switching out of, even if you have to jumble up your schedule."| "-0.25, -1.0"
"Going into this class I was extremely afraid from the horror stories I heard about how difficult this class is. Thus, I was determined to do well in this class. Although I had a very poor physics background, I did well in the class. I was in Mrs. Rasmussen's office around twice a week and she helped me successfully navigate through this course."| "0.75, -0.5"
"Doesn't even show up for lab, and gives the TAs tough grading criteria so that you fail if you leave out one minor detail on your writeup. Formal lab writeups take forever to do, around 10 hours at the minimum if you want any grade higher than a B-. Take this lab at a community college, if possible."| "-1.0, -1.0"
"She is genuinely interested in students learning the material and always shows up to class full of energy and ready to teach. However, you must pay attention to a lot of details that she goes over in class as well as her online notes for a chance at a good grade. She is confusing at times, but is very happy to clarify herself during office hours."| "0.25, -0.0"

"Simple. You have to take this lab with her overseeing it currently at UTD. Two options: 1. Work your butt off to get a C in the lab (I got A+ in lecture) 2. Take at community college and work your but off to get an A. (Physics is hard for most) Miss a small detail in  your write-up? 20 pts off. Expect a lot of 60's unless you spend 9 hrs on labs."| "-1.0, -1.0"
"Avoid at all costs. She boasts that because of her pre-med students did well on their MCATs, but I highly doubt that.

"Pre-med student here.  I knew going in PHYS would be my biggest challenge.  Rasmussen made that challenge even greater as she simply cannot explain things (to me at least) clearly.   That said, you won't find a more dedicated teacher on campus.   No shortcuts here.  Do the extra credit and HW and you'll be ok."| "-0.5, -1.0"
"Not sure why she has bad ratings. She's the sweetest, most enthusiastic prof at UTD. Go to class, take good notes, redo in-class probs. If you don't understand something, ask for help-she's always glad to help her students. Also, hw q's are longerharder than test questions imo.   An A is totally achievable. What you put in is what you get out."| "0.25, -0.0"
"She doesn't teach you concepts and instead goes through practice problems expecting you to know the concepts. The homework is hard, the quizzes are poorly worded, and the tests are tough. The extra credit is the only way to do well in the class. However, she is good at responding to emails is willing to help her students understand the material."| "-0.5, -1.0"
"Rasmussen's an acquired taste. Her enthusiasm may be striking, and borderline scary, but she's a kind, helpful person that knows you're not stupid and just wants to help you learn. Though quirky, she's actually a pretty awesome person if you talk to her about your concerns. Go to lecture, do HW regularly. PRACTICE PROBLEMS. They will save your GPA."| "0.25, -0.0"
"Let me tl:dr this for you. This is not a class worth taking. If you want an easy A take David Lary for that. Her homework is relatively easy because if you can't figure it out then Google can save you by googling the problem. The exams are just stupidly written but not hard. Lectures are not worth going too because she is not clear about anything."| "-1.0, -0.5"
"I've been taking this course all semester long and i aint never seen this woman in person! The labs are ridiculously way harder than they should be, they basically consume your whole week. The TA's take off points for whatever reason, you misspell your name and that's like 5 points off. The lab is harder than the lecture."| "-1.0, -1.0"
"Labs are so ridiculous. A ONE credit hour lab section shouldn't require a minimum of 3-6 hrs a week doing lab writeups, it just doesn't make sense. Also labs are very repetitive, each section requires multiple trials even when the outcome is very obvious. A good TA is your only saviour."| "-0.5, 0.5"
"Labs are easy but TIME CONSUMING. Each takes 3-5 hrs, but the formal lap writeups can take up to 8-10 hrs. Pray that you get a good TA. Mine explained the theory and concepts and all equations before we started the lab so no one was confused. Some of my friends got bad TA's who grade very harshly and take off lots of points for simple errors.G'luck"| "-0.75, 0.5"
"The labs she writes are god awful. Completely waste of time, redundant, and pointless. Unclear instructions, and if you email for help she will tell you to get lost.

"HORRIBLE! She jumps right into lecture without telling you what you are learning. Her examples in class are easy. The homework is lengthy and extremely hard.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS."| "-1.0, -1.0"

"If you get him for CS5330 or CS2340, well good luck you are doomed. There is just way too much work to do in his class. He doesn't teach properly and expects perfect answers and code.

"Professor Goodrum is an alright professor. Some people will say he's the worst professor in CS at UTD, which I think is a little dramatic, but I would certainly not take his class if you have any other option.

"He's the worst teacher I've ever met! He's so bad at teaching with tediously reading slides and boring gossips.

Over half students got grade C at the end."| "-1.0, -1.0"
"AVOID AT ALL COSTS! I don't say that about any professors, btw, but he is the exception.

That said, it is a great course to shore up ur maths."| "1.0, -1.0"

"Professor Karrah is amazing. His lectures are helpful to understand the concepts. His exams and pop quizzes require writing codes which I think relevant to this programming course.

"Professor Dabkowski is one of the best professors I've ever had at UT Dallas. MATH 4301 is a tough course, and the weekly homework can sometimes be over 10 pages long, but he made it worth it. He's accessible outside of class during office hours, and his lecture style is excellent for understanding the proofs and concepts."| "1.0, -0.0"
"Professor Dabkowski is one of the nicest professors I've ever had, and his lectures are fun and engaging. He publishes his notes for the lectures so you can review them or catch up on anything you missed.

"Dabkowski's classes can be hard, but he is a great teacher who cares about his students. He's funny too!

Only minor downside is that he's not tech-savvy."| "1.0, -0.5"

"Professor Dabkowski generally teaches in a very understandable way, but the content of his courses is incredibly difficult so it can still be tough.

Great in office hours, and clearly cares a lot about his students."| "1.0, -0.5"
"In summer 22, we had open note, open book exams, part take home, part in class. He posts elearning participation quizzes after each class which sometimes take a while but have unlimited attempts.

"This class is a lot of work, but the tests were easy. He is very experienced in IMS, but he is a bad teacher.

Hw would be due that were several chapters ahead of what he had gone over in class. He hardly answered emails."| "-1.0, -0.5"
"Valid professor, but too much work, but not to the point where you wanna drop out. He has 10 homeworks, 2 exams and take-home essays (NOT-cumulative), and one huge group project.

"DO NOT TAKE. Assigns surprise group presentations throughout the semester. Doesn't actually lecture, just wastes time talking about his opinions on random events.

"Professor Davis actual made a government class bearable for once in my life. Her lectures were great, and the tests were pretty easy, as long as you read the articles and came to class. She gives extra credit for attendance and drops your lowest test grade."| "1.0, 0.5"
"Her lectures are funny and she finds analogies which make the material interesting. You can get extra credit through attendance as well as bonus questions on exams. No assignments at all, grade is determined by exams that are multiple choice (you can also drop your lowest exam). Study her slides and you will get an A."| "1.0, 0.5"
"She's probably one of the best professors I've had here at UTD. The only grades are five tests, and she drops the lowest one. That means if you're satisfied with the grade you have after the first four, you can just not show up to the last test. Her lectures are actually interesting and she's adorable. I definitely recommend her!"| "1.0, 1.0"

"Professor Davis is a very nice lady. Though, her test questions are really wordy and confusing, make sure you study all of her slides especially the ones that you think can be used as a trick question. Her review is useless unless you want a passing grade. There is 1 extra credit for each test, 5 total. No quizzes or attendance requires."| "-0.5, -0.5"
"No homework/attendance policy, only grades are 5 test grades and she drops the lowest. Really easy to follow lectures, she hands out extra credit and answers to test questions just for showing up.

"Professor Davis is a solid choice for a Political Science professor. She is very accessible outside of class and tries to help her students.

"Stay away! Exam 1 was OK. Questions were doable, covered stuff from class. Exam 2, we could chose between doing the hard or easy section of the exam.

Lectures are a bit heavy but fun to attend. Topics for interviews covered too."| "1.0, -0.5"

I wish I would have taken him for Databases as well."| "1.0, 0.5"
"Took for dig. logic and database, DL was rough, I felt there wasn't enough help to get a high grade on exams.

He was also super approachable if anyone had any questions."| "1.0, -0.0"

"She is one of the most interesting professors I have had in my college career. I have learned so much in this course, and the work load is more than reasonable.

"The takeaway I have from this class is that teaching this course is last on her priority list. Students areexpected to remind theprofessor topost assignments,readingmaterials.

"This class is very homework heavy, but it's really good for learning. Dr. Morales has good lectures and the exams are pretty much carbon copies of her lectures . If you go to the exam reviews nothing on the exams should surprise you. The exams are easy, but be strategic about your limited time. The homework was the hardest part."| "1.0, -0.5"
"Solid professor when it comes to the material. She is very thorough and there is a lot of writing involved. It was worth it for me because I really learned the material after so much repetition!

"Didn't like her at first, but she is actually a very good teacher and is very helpful. Has weekly homework and quizzes.

Overall, you have to work for it but I recommend her class."| "0.5, -0.5"
"Let me say, I really hated her at first, A LOT.  Yes, it's true, she gives an enormous amount of homework, maybe 10+ hours per week.

Really wish I had taken her for Discrete Math 1 instead of Farage."| "0.5, -0.5"

"Prof. McAfee's class were always worth going to as his lecture/notes were easy to follow. Assigned homework problems and posted a study guide that was very helpful for exams.

"He is amazing. Make sure you come to class and listen carefully to his lectures. There are 4 exams but he will curve according to the class's performance. The final exam is the easiest one.

"Excellent choice. Tax is tough, but Solcher makes it easy. He curved the exams based on the aggregate of the grades throughout the class.

His two projects are not too bad either."| "0.5, -0.5"

"Murthy is a passionate teacher. His slides are full of examples and exercises. I met him at ofc hrs and got good career and grad-school advice.

"He did struggle a bit being new to UTD but some of the reviews here are too harsh! He replies quickly on Teams. He mentioned when attendance was low but didn't take attendance.

"This prof has more policy than others. I wish he was a bit relaxed but I got used to them hard after first few assignments.

"Prof. Murthy is a great teacher. His slides are detailed and full of examples. The course is abt databases but he connects it to other CS areas so students see how and why things work.

"One thing no one else mentioned is that he doesn't accept any other formats besides .docx, .pptx, or .xlsx.

I hope he follows up on his end of semester commitment to improve for fall 2021."| "-0.5, -0.5"
"Worst professor I have had during my entire academics. I have taken classes both inside and outside the US, never have I met a professor with no grading criteria whatsoever.

"Honestly, one of the worst professors I've had. He literally took off points on my first exam because he didn't like the way I worded something.

Sometimes she rushes through parts of the lecture, but she's more than willing to clarify. Easy announced quizzes, extra credit attendance quizzes, straightforward exams that resemble practice problems."| "1.0, 1.0"
"She is truly one of the most passionate and caring professors that I have had so far at UTD. She truly wants everyone one of her students to pass and do well. When she notices that we didn't do well on our first test, she went above and beyond to make sure that we wouldn't do bad in her class for the rest of semester. Highly recommend!"| "1.0, -0.0"
"Dr. Stefan is by far most caring Professor I have seen. She cares for her students and will work out time to help you even though she is super busy. Her lectures are ok since ochem's are self study class,but she explains material well with recitation every week. Her quiz are doable just need to study for it. Exams are standardized and are tough."| "0.5, -0.5"
"Wonderful professor. However, quizzes are tough and the exams are killer. Go to class and keep up with the material. The Spring 2016 Final exam was so hard that I'm pretty sure it ruined a lot of students' grades. It wrecked everyone's hard work this entire semester. Beware of the final exam."| "0.25, -0.5"
"Dr. Stefan is probably the most passionate chemistry professor I've met. She knows her stuff, and is very good at teaching. Her class is the first to fill up most of the time.  Quizzes are do-able. not too easy or hard. Go to class, office hours, peer tutoring and you will destroy OCHEM."| "0.5, -0.5"
"Dr. Stefan is a great Ochem II professor. Her quizzes are pretty straight forward and easy.

"Professor Art genuinely wants his students to learn and he wants to give good grades. I took Fundamentals of Taxation I. The course is tough. Lots of materials covered during the lectures.

"I took Agulnek for Tax 1 and I learned a lot but definitely had to earn my grade. The class consisted of 3 exams, 2 projects, and a final.

Overall, make sure to read a lot and do problems."| "0.0, -0.5"
"Exams are very difficult. Lots of specific questions, so read the book, work and understand the practice problems The projects seem daunting at first but you will get through it.

"I wrote one of the more negative comments at an earlier point. However, I have returned to change my remarks. The first time around taking Agulnek's course, I was discouraged, and overwhelmed, and subsequently, I dropped the class. This time round, however, I have a more appropriate course load, and thus, time to really study, and I'm doing great!"| "0.5, -1.0"
"Professor Agulnek is by far the most knowledgeable professor I've taken. It helps to read the material before attending the lecture so he can clear up some of the more confusing content. His tests are based primarily on hw questions and online quizzes provided through elearning (not mandatory). He's stern, but very friendly. A great professor"| "1.0, -0.0"
"I only felt adding something to this discussion because among a university with some sub par profs, he is one of the best.  He isnt easy but his tests make you know the material, which is more than can be said for some of the other classes.  Read the book, do the study guide, relisten to class lectures online and go to class."| "0.75, -0.5"
"The other comments on here are so dramatic, don't even listen to them. His class is NOT that bad. You need to read the chapters, do the homework, and go to class - if you do all that, you'll be fine. You'd have to try pretty hard to fail this class. Out of my section of 45, 17 people got A's and only 2 people failed."| "0.5, -0.5"
"All the previous comments are spot on! Avoid him! Save your money! Even if you do all of your work, like me, I maintained a 3.9 till his class, your going to fail.

"He's a new prof so he'll improve in a few semesters but my experience wasn't the best for the Spring semester. He made lots of mistakes in lectures and made simple concepts unnecessarily complicated. Only reason to attend lectures are pop quizzes. Exams are just poorly worded homework problems and there's no curve despite 50 averages on the exams"| "-0.5, -0.5"
"One of the most caring professors I have had. He hosted a few study sessions outside of class (Fridays), one while he had a research commitment at UTSW. He made a few mistakes in class because he's new, but he'd send an e-mail out fixing it. VERY LITTLE EXTRA CREDIT, NO CURVES."| "0.5, -0.5"

"Lacks experience and had to use other professors' slides but is still good. He understands and explains the material well, but he could go too fast at times.

"statistics wasn't my cup of tea but the professor provided alot of extra materials. make sure that you do well on the hws, aim for 10/10- it'll save you! he drops quizzes, and you're allowed one side of a notecard (midterm) and two sides (final). be ready to put in the work! :)"| "0.5, -0.5"
"Important to note that he is hard-lined on not curving grades. Also I felt the midterm was probably harder than it should've been, but otherwise I had a solid experience. Great and engaging lectures, opportunities for extra credit, always willing to help his students. Just be aware that you'll have to put in a lot of work to succeed in his class."| "0.5, -0.5"
"i think he's a great guy and clearly very knowledgable on the subject he's teaching but I genuinely felt lost most of the time in this class because of how he presented the material. my theory is that since he's new at teaching and fresh out of academia (harvard nonetheless) he's used to working with graduate/postgrad students usually."| "0.0, -0.5"
"It's only his 2nd semester, he just needs some more experience to be more comfortable in front of class and lecturing. His curve is that he doesn't believe in minuses so you can get a B or B+, etc. He also uses the homework as extra points to your final grade and provides point incentives to do well on exams if the class meets a certain grade."| "0.5, -0.5"
"GOOD 1. Gives LOTS of study material including previous exams that r EXTREMELY helpful 2. Pass/fail quizzes, half of em are dropped 3. Attendance isn't mandatory but recommended 4.

"Dr. Smiley's clear instructions made this a fun but difficult class. The grading is fair, and Dr. Smiley does all he can to assist students without hand-holding.

"STAT 3355 is mainly a programming class to implement statistical methods. The homework load is relatively low (8 homework assignments) and there is a group project with a randomly assigned partner.

"The Midterm was quite tricky but he had given us an example mid term prior, and it was quite similar so that was a plus. The grading can be very tricky as you don't really know what you have to put to get the full grade in exams. He is very accessible outside of class, and explains very clearly and thoroughly during office hours. Also quite funny"| "0.5, -0.0"
"The class is extremely chill if you are some what of a serious student. Doesn't give surprises but the material can be challenging if you don't study until the last week before an exam. Pretty easy A and pretty much impossible to get below a C. Gives open note PQs but they aren't mandatory because exam grade can replace them in case you miss class."| "0.5, -0.0"
"Have some practice before attending the class. 5 projects with varying levels of difficulty(make sure you attend the class where he explains the guidelines, he drops hints), quizzes are open note so they're pretty ez if you know where to look, only bad thing is final, make sure you study for it. Otherwise very accessible, practice in class with him"| "0.5, -0.0"
"Dr. Short's assignments frequently contained errors. His exam questions were confusing. Much of the class was learning random IT terms. Dr. Short attempts to respond to student feedback.

"Honestly, this class is challenging: you will struggle on tests, and class will be confusing, but I would not say it reflects on Professor Short.

I would recommend him because you can tell he cares about our opinions."| "0.5, -0.5"

"Maybe I'm one of the only people who liked him, but I thought he was a pretty good professor. He could be a bit boring sometimes, but he had insightful comments about the readings that helped me decipher the more confusing ones. His class certainly wasn't challenging, and I have more reading assigned nightly in my neuroscience class than in here."| "1.0, 1.0"
"He's probably the most boring professor in the world.  The amount of reading in this class is absolutely ridiculous.

Avoid if possible!!"| "-0.5, -0.5"

"Do not take this class!!! If you care about your GPA at all, do not take this class! He counts off for dumb things, and it is impossible to make an A. Does not give A+.

He is a tough grader on papers and I have just generally been unimpressed with this class."| "-0.25, -0.0"
"Dr. Wickberg is brilliant and has a great sense of humor.

"Dr. Rachinskiy is super humble (he literally introduced himself as Dmitry) and helpful. He dumbed down Diff Eq a lot so it was easy to understand; his lectures are clear and entertaining.

"I'll be honest, I skipped his lectures after the first few weeks. But that's mostly because I do better teaching myself. The TA's go over what the quiz will be about the day of the quiz.

"Best prof for course. Do the homework as they are the quizzes which are 25% of grade. Lectures are good but honestly if you want to do well, go to the Mathlab weekly sessions if you can. Much more helpful than anything in lecture, simplifies concepts the profs over complicate. Work through as many problem you can and you will do fine."| "1.0, -0.5"
"Best Diff Eq prof by far. Lectures are comprehensive and actually worth going to although attendance is not mandatory. Very helpful and kind in office hours.

"At first I thought he was a jerk which maybe he is but the class really is enjoyable. Funny and entertaining lectures. Im not rating 5 stars and rating lower on difficulty because he doesnt teach you how to do the assignments.

"He is an EASY grader but one thing I really dont like is that he doesnt teach you how to use Excel or Tableau.

No exams, few homeworks, 1 page paper and 2 easy group projects."| "1.0, 0.5"
"Interesting lecturer (goes off topic, so idk how much i learned?) No exams, assignments and 2 group presentations.

Just do your WileyPlus, and go to the tech lab for help on your Excel and Access cases. There are two exams: while the first one requires extensive textbook studying, the second one does not at all. Should be an easy A."| "0.75, 1.0"

"I'm going to start with this: he's not bad. I never saw the professor (TA-run lab). There were prerecorded lectures (~15 min), but I stopped watching them because he is very monotonous and you can get the info from the notes. Anyway, it doesn't matter what professor you get for lab courses, just hope you get a good TA."| "0.5, 0.5"
"Easy going lab prof. If you read pre lab notes, weekly quizzes are multiple choice and easy. Have to prepare lab procedure yourself as pre lab which you have to follow. Answers question at end of lab based on results as a group. Final exam based on previous quizzes with questions provided before hand. 80% for A. One quiz dropped. TA grades all."| "1.0, 1.0"
"Organic Chemistry II with Dr. Shah wasn't bad at all! All of the tests and quiz have one bonus question, and he posts a lot of helpful materials on elearning. Some of the questions come straight from old quizzes or practice problems that he posts. Everything is multiple choice! Study the materials, slides and textbook - you'll get an A!"| "1.0, 0.5"

Would definitely recommend taking him if you can!"| "1.0, 0.5"

"He's honestly the best lab professor ever! He doesn't believe in giving below a 95% on pre-labs, and his quizzes are easy. His TA is a little annoying, but she's still helpful. The final exam was just all of the previous quizzes combined. He won't fail you, he's never had a student that failed. Take him! He's amazing! Guaranteed A!"| "1.0, 0.5"
"Professor Shah goes above and beyond. He is patient, will explain the science behind the labs, and truly wants you to learn. He is a great professor and I would truly recommend him.

Her nebulous guidance led me to want to drop the course."| "-1.0, -0.5"
"I recommend taking this class if your life has felt a little too pleasant lately and you need something to bring you down a notch or seven.

"Dr. Lingo is incredibly kind an interesting. She picks a good selection of fun plays to watch and to act, and she loves theatre with a passion.

Overall, great professor"| "0.0, 1.0"
"Professor Lingo is such a fun lady and really cares for her students. She really spent time adapting the class so that we could learn over Microsoft Teams.

"Prof. Lingo is one of the best, toughest, and most caring professors I have ever had. She is tough but also respects her student's efforts. I have had her for multiple classes (THEA 2372 being my first) and she always pushes her students to work harder and "increase the capacity" of their 100% effort, so it is more like 1,000%."| "1.0, -0.5"

"Kathy is awesome. But you have to be on her good side to do well in any of her classes. Be kind, take critiques seriously, and show up to class.

"Dr. Lingo is a gem of a professor. Her extensive theatre experience and hilarious stage presence make for lectures that never bore. Shes genuinely caring and takes the class to multiple live shows on nights out. Easy A if you are engaged and positive, regardless of how much theatre experience you have. Graded based on essays and a group project."| "1.0, 1.0"
"I took Improv 1 as a mandatory credit towards my theater major. I thought this class was going to be a walk-in-the-park beginners' course, but boy was I wrong. Kathy has such a wonderful way of working with people of all skill levels. Helping inexperienced participants find their footing and getting technical with experienced actors. It was a joy!"| "1.0, -0.0"
"I took Honors Understanding Theatre and loved it. The professor is really passionate and engaging, and she makes theater fun. However, some language and innuendos made me uncomfortable. We attended plays and wrote critiques, and we produced our own performance as our final. No tests, but participation is a must."| "1.0, -0.5"
"Honors Understanding Theatre with Lingo helped keep me sane. You really learn to understand the process behind creating theater as Lingo and guests teach different aspects of theater before you and a group produce and perform a selection from a play at the end of the sem.

"Simple assignment, follow a template to write a cover letter and resume. He took 50/100 points off because I submitted my document with my resume above my cover letter.

"Dr. Addante is very passionate about what he teaches. He can be a bit intimidating at first, but if you get to know him, he is one of the nicest professors that you'll encounter at UTD.

"This course is the right amount of challenging. He often goes into great depth beyond the scope of his exams in his lectures. He is also a very effective communicator.

She is a nice person, but the long group paper makes no sense (just have it be above 10 pages, not 20, you're not going to read it), she doesn't grade until after reviews are due, and she doesn't explain her grades. The type to go "not everyone gets an A". Good for one class, not again"| "-0.5, 0.5"
"The class I was not looking forward to I actually enjoyed the most. She's not a very tough grader, her assignments are actually helpful for you and your future.

I highly recommend her!"| "1.0, -1.0"
"It's really a shame she is the only professor that teaches this course. She does nothing, teaches nothing, just plays videos in class, tells you to read the book and then you on your own.

"Prof. Johnson introduces a lot of interesting ideas in critical analysis, but many applications were a bit of a stretch. The class material is still interesting.

"I love Fred! A lot of people in my class had a bad attitude and treated him poorly but he handled it with grace and more patience than I would have.

One of my fav professors."| "1.0, 1.0"

I took this class for fun and I regret it. he never acted in films.. so why is he teaching this course? overall, if he wasn't so rude and had boring lectures, the class could be more fun. we had to do a monologue from the play (Idk why it wasn't a film) the seagull which was so boring."| "-0.5, -0.0"
"This was my second class with Fred and my first in person. I didn't think I could like him more but I do! He is tough on you but it is because he cares and wants you to improve.

"While it's cool he lets you call him by his first name, I would gladly say that his Shakespeare in Performance class was half enjoyable.

"I loved Professor Curchack! He knows his stuff and truly cares about helping his students improve in whatever they do. He is very flexible and wants everyone to succeed.

You go over so many topics and fields and Curchack talks as if he were a friend but he is wise (must be 70 something years old) My peers were overwhelmed by assignments but they're not bad.

Fun class supports discovery."| "0.5, 0.5"

"The hwk assignments take about 2-4 hours, once a week. No midterms/final. Easy A if you do the weekly assignments. Class is more than boring, he goes off on tangents about himself every 5 minutes.

I learned nothing, but at least I got an A?"| "-0.5, 0.5"
"While Fred is clearly passionate about his work, his passion for himself often became the subject matter of the class. While I understand Fred's mastery of his art agree with his talent, unless they start offering "Curchack on Curchack," he'll probably continue to lecture from his own life. Still, though, teach what you know."| "-0.5, 0.5"

"Always promptly answers student questions, always posts clear notes with clearly worked examples. Clear and upfront with assignments, and lectures perfectly explain the course material.

"(Fall 2020) Professor is chill. Explains the topics pretty well. Dunno about when the class is in-person but he made a class discord which made him accessible really easily.

"His lectures usually don't use the entire time slot. Everything he says is very concise and he gives real world context for most things.

"Great prof. 10/10 recommend. 4 Exams total, 1 is dropped. HW is 10% I never went to class about 50% of the time and passed with a high grade. She offers extra credit for attendance. The course is based on TopHat and is easy to understand. She is a good lecturer and I left feeling like I learned a lot."| "1.0, 1.0"

"The second easiest class I will ever take. There are weekly quizzes, and the exams are open note and open book. She drops the lowest exam grade (so you don't need to take the comprehensive final).

"She's a new professor but literally the BEST. She's passionate about her subject, cares about her students, and offers several extra credit opportunities. You will use an online subscription-based textbook with weekly quizzes but they're super easy with infinite attempts and the exams are all taken from the textbook. Totally recommend for easy A."| "1.0, 1.0"

"Her class is definitely my favorite so far. An easy A. I love her lecture style. Shes really flexible with how you attend class. She drops your lowest exam grade so many students skip the final. Weekly hw easy to make 100 on. Exams straight from hw and lectures  easy A. She offers extra credit. She is kind, and passionate about teaching govt."| "1.0, 1.0"
"Dr. Ramirez is the best! Super straightforward class! Weekly quizzes (short) embedded into online textbooks, 3 exams + final, and lowest is dropped. She provides extra credit opportunities for the whole class. Very easy to score 100 for all quiz grades. I even registered for another class of hers next semester."| "1.0, 0.5"

"Dr. Ramirez was really flexible with how we could attend lecture, and gave 2 options for extra credit. We had a reading "quiz" at the end of every week, but as long as you tried, you're pretty much guaranteed a 100 on those. She drops the lowest test grade, which includes the final"| "1.0, 0.5"
"Dr. Ramirez is an amazing teacher! The class is an easy A. You only take 3 open-book exams online and if you're satisfied with the grades, you can exempt yourself from taking the final.

"Should not be a required ATEC course. Attendance is required just to get people to show up to class. Participation grades are locked behind an online book the professor gets paid for that is a history recap and reads like it was AI generated . Everything in class is just a recap of what is read in the modules a week or two before."| "-1.0, 1.0"
"lectures are boring and unimportant. repeats everything from the required textbook modules. attendance is made mandatory due to entry/exit tickets. there is a lecture class (led by her) and a discussion class (led by one of the TAs). midterms were extremely easy and discussion assignments can be easy too depending on your TA."| "-1.0, 1.0"
"A lot of the reviews here are due to anger at the requirement of this course. I agree, the course doesn't seem necessary and most is general history knowledge from high school. However, Prof. Balsamo is extremely passionate, and I often see her talking to students before/after class. The textbook is $90 and a mandatory online buy to pass the class."| "1.0, 0.5"
"I'm glad this class is over. She's a good person, but her class was very underwhelming. It's a required course too, and not only that expect to spend 100 dollars on an online book that you don't get to keep. It's gone after the semester. She repeated everything the book stated. Most of the time you'll be doodling. It's a waste of time."| "-1.0, 0.5"

"Literally so confused on why this class even exists. All of the stuff in this class is common sense and most people spend their time in the mandatory lectures sleeping or browsing the web. Some TAs will grade harshly for no particular reason and the professor and TAs take this class way more seriously than it should be."| "-0.5, 0.5"
"Only took this class because it was required for ATEC. $95 online textbook required, you can't buy it used because she updates it every year. Class does have interesting content, however is in no way related to ATEC. No clear rubrics for any project, so you have lots of creative freedom on projects, however TAs don't have a strict way to grade you."| "-1.0, 0.5"
"Unnecessary class. Lectures are boring and a repeat of homework. Attendance is for a grade. Discussion portion of this class was better than lecture. A lot of "reading" that you don't need to do. Midterm they gave us she didn't even count afterwards. Prof Balsamo is so unorganized, TA's were great for dealing with her."| "-0.5, -0.0"
"So she picks a fancy auditorium. Then, you gotta check in with your student ID (Fancy!)..and once you enter the auditorium, you're greeted by a bunch of TAs who worked so hard to get there. And those fancy ceremony booklets! Plus weekly labs with the same TAs. We've all guessed why she gets away with this useless class. Let's just leave it at that."| "-1.0, 1.0"
"You HAVE to show up. There's no other choice. Every entry/exit ticket is for a participation grade. The textbook material is fairly interesting (just not for me ig), but the textbook can't be found anywhere else, so be prepared to pay. Also why do both the lecture and the discussion section go over the modules? Why can't it be left to one of them?"| "-0.5, -0.0"

"This class will literally make you fall asleep no matter what. Most of the stuff here is common knowledge such as the history of photography, and some of the TA's are biased. On the midterm this year, there was a huge biased grading cause she forgot to give them a rubric to grade objectively. If not a graduation requirement, wouldn't have taken it."| "-1.0, 0.5"
"Class is super easy. Midterms are given in a week's advance and are online. Her lectures are sometimes interesting, but it's super easy to zone out. However, if you are taking this class to learn something, you will probably be disappointed. Everything taught in this class is essentially comment sense."| "0.5, 1.0"
"This isn't a very academic course. The lectures feel like a student presenting a project, and the textbook reads like a high schooler's essay, which by the way, the textbook is all virtual, and mandatory for the course. ($80) You don't actually interact with the Dean all that much; most of your discussions happen with teaching assistants."| "0.0, 0.5"

"I really don't think this should be required for ATEC. Sadly, the only reason why I showed up to the lectures was because of the discussion section, not because of interest. She is very kind but the class itself is not exciting whatsoever and you might fall asleep. If attendance wasnt mandatory I definitely would not have shown up at all."| "0.0, 0.5"
"Absolutely no point to the class. I felt like I learned nothing. Balsamo does fine giving the lectures, but the class is what was really bad. I had a terrible TA who had no idea what he was doing, so choose wisely. I'm pretty sure her TA's are just her friends that she has accumulated throughout her career and they do not belong in teaching"| "-0.5, -0.5"
"To be completely honest, I did not even slightly understand the purpose of this class. It was completely jumbled and all of our cool projects felt wasted and misunderstood. I loved the discussion group portion of the class, as my TA was great. But everything just felt a bit rushed and pointless, and it honestly just felt like a guinea pig class."| "-0.5, 1.0"
"This class was a mess. I felt like my instructor was just as lost as the students. Discussions barely had any correlation with the lectures and were led horribly. Made us buy a bunch of books that we barely used. I would suggest to choose your instructor wisely. The lectures weren't that bad but they did get a bit monotonous."| "-0.5, -0.0"
"Ms. Balsamo is the dean of ATEC and a wonderful person. She teaches the big 300 student lectures, then splits us up into discussion sections with her TA's.

Some people try to say that this class is pointless, but they just don't get it."| "0.5, -0.0"

"Overrated. Needs to do more practice work with the class before exams and give more time on quizzes.

Office hours also helpful."| "0.5, 0.5"

Let go of your ego and you'll get an A."| "0.5, 0.5"

The class was twice a week, Tues. was lecture and Thur. was totally online(he would post an online quiz every Thurs and it was due by Sat night.)

"Alot of work to say the least. We had 11 quizes and 11 abstracts, one of each due at the end of the week on friday through webct and turnitin.com. do not need book, but you will become familiar with wikipedia. if you can write the abstracts and correlate that into a broader argument in a final format, your good to go. went to class once a week."| "0.25, -0.0"

"Good professor, humorous, very enthusiastic about the subject. Somewhat opinionated on the field, but doesn't present opinions as fact.

Fair but tough in grading, be advised."| "0.25, -0.5"

Didn't use textbooks."| "1.0, -0.5"

"EXTREMELY boring. Monotone lecturer, though he can be funny sometimes. Exams are more from the reading than notes.

"Professor Hashim was one of the teachers I encountered during my first semester and she is easily one of my favorite.

"Dr. Lee knows a ton about physics and expects you to do the same. Lectures were very good, however lecture slides were relatively useless when using them for homework. I went to his office hours a few times and every time he was very condescending. Tests are 2/3 concept based and the rest is math, tests are hard but similar to homework."| "-0.5, -0.5"
"I was worried about switching to him since Kuei Sun left UTD. But, he was an excellent lecturer and very good at explaining things. Your grade is homework and tests with 5% weighted practice tests but homework and practice tests are unlimited attempts. For tests, memorize slides and do homework problems and you'll get an A overall with the curve."| "1.0, -0.5"
"This professor was one of the best I've had! He clearly knows what he is teaching when it comes to physics.

Speaks clearly and gets the point through."| "1.0, -0.0"
"Dr. Lee is the first professor ive ever had where its obvious he wants you to pass. The exams are TOUGH but he curves based on a histogram, rather than the highest grade of all students like most profs do. I had heavy course load, couldnt dedicate a lot of time to this class, and still passed."| "1.0, 1.0"
"Hated this class. To be honest if professors are going to test you on something, they should go over it! Never went over math, just expects you to figure it out with the textbook. Definitely a professor who cares about his students, but doesn't know how to teach stuff that pertains to the exam."| "-1.0, -1.0"
"Found the lectures to be very helpful in understanding the material. The class consisted of weekly HW, 3 exams, and a final. He implemented honorlock after Exam I due to cheating but the class is graded on a curve so 70s on the exam could still net you an A depending on how the class did. Listen to lectures + do the HW and you'll be fine."| "0.5, -0.0"
"Lectures are difficult pretty overwhelming sometimes but you can't blame him it is a concept heavy course. I didn't attend the recitation sessions from the TA or read the textbook. Do the lectures and do the Mp, invest in Chegg ONLY FOR THE HW. REDO THE MP BEFORE TESTS and keep a formula sheet ready for the HW (makes much easier). Hard, but not bad"| "0.5, -0.5"
"Mark Lee explains the concepts a lot and likes to go into a lot of detail about where an equation comes from and how to derive it. He spends a lot of time going over explaining an equation and concepts rather than applying them. Imagine taking a calculus class where all they show you are the equations, but never show examples or apply them."| "-1.0, -1.0"
"Grading for this class was pretty confusing- tests are hard and heavily curved so that 70-80s equate to an A. Dr. Lee is a solid lecturer though and accessible outside of class so as long as you put in the effort and ride the curve you should be fine."| "1.0, -0.0"
"Dr. Lee is an amazing lecturer, he knows the material and is able to explain concepts really well. However, his exams are brutal, so there's usually a curve on the final grade. We only had mastering physics as homework and he does "spot check" attendance, where he randomly calls on a student to answer a question related to the topic he's going over"| "0.5, -0.5"
"Dr. Lee was fantastic and knowledgeable at explaining and he's one of the best physics professors at UTD, but the class structure was weird. He calls on everyone whether or not you know the answer, and the exams are purposely tougher for the sake of the MCAT however not every student is a premed.. Around 30% of the class will get some form of A."| "0.5, -0.5"
"Physics is not my strong suite, but I survived. The curve helped me because many students did so poorly that my less than average test scores made the cut. Read before class because he calls on students to answer questions, and visit his office hours. Complete *all* the homework assignments (definitely invest in chegg for the semester)."| "0.5, -0.5"
"Too difficult for a freshman level course. Exams are brutal, especially the final. The homework is unforgiving as well . The only saving grace is that he adapts the grading scale based off overall class performance, but due to this, you can never know your grade until after the class is over. Needless to say, it's quite the gamble."| "-0.5, -1.0"
"The biggest mistake I made in the undergrad career was taking Lee for college physics. His exams were super long and wordy, and had multiple steps so it took up a lot of time to read, comprehend and finish the problem.

"One of the most organized professors I've ever taken. Crystal-clear lectures make the otherwise difficult subject matter easy to understand.

"Thermodynamics is my least favorite topic in physics. However, this class is essential and Prof. Lee has a way of making this class -very- interesting by relating it to real world concepts.

"He has changed the grading policy so many times, especially when the semester is ending. These changes forced us to prepare harder for the final exam.

"Very unclear with the grading criteria, removed one of the drop exams on the syllabus at the very end of the semester. Unclear in lecture, and unfair with the way he's structured the class.

"He's a somewhat decent guy who is pretty knowledgeable about finance and is willing to answer any questions that you have.

"You have 3 exams, each worth 30% of your final grade. Half of the exams are calculations that we did in class, the other half are free response questions.

"This is the most irritating professor I have ever taken at UTD. Shell write that you did perfect on your rubric but then take off points for no reason.

Super strict about being on phone"| "-1.0, -1.0"
"I've never rated a professor before, that's how bad this class and prof. Miller is.

Needless to say, I rather take this class than do 100 Hrs of community service."| "1.0, -0.5"

"You do not want to do this to yourself. Please. Your GPA will crumble, and so will your sanity. This professor needs to take a course on how to be a proper professor. Even her syllabus needs help.

"She has way too many assignments. I think the blog posts are easy and interesting, but 3 article responses and having to read three books is entirely unnecessary and inconsiderate to the fact that students have other classes, jobs, and many other things going on.
